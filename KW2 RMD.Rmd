####Obtain MetaData with entrez_search()----
```{r MetaData}
#Verify database's search terms
entrez_db_searchable("nuccore")

#Database choice: The sequences data will be obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) RefSeq records, which provides a curated, non-redundant collection of high-quality sequences (Pruitt et al., 2007). This source was chosen to help facilitate data filtering and quality control, and reduce some sources of error (e.g. database sequence errors, misclassifications, low quality sequences, and the inclusion of regions outside of the 16S rRNA gene region). 


#Search NCBI's Nucleotide database for 16S rRNA Refseq records for Actinobacteria. This was then repeated for Firmicutes. Limited to 4000 hits for each taxa to prevent either taxa from being overrepresented in the model. Web history objects were used to support the high number of hits in entrez_fetch(). 
actino_search<-entrez_search(db = "nuccore", term = "(Actinobacteria[ORGN] AND (33175[BioProject] OR 33317[BioProject])", retmax = 4000,  use_history=TRUE)

#Check how many records are available for this search set
actino_max <- actino_search$count

#Search NCBI's Nucleotide database for 16S rRNA Refseq records for Firmicutes.  
firmi_search<-entrez_search(db = "nuccore", term = "(Firmicutes[ORGN] AND (33175[BioProject] OR 33317[BioProject])", retmax = 4000,  use_history=TRUE)

firmi_max <- firmi_search$count
```


####Fetch Sequence Data using entrez_fetch()----
```{r Fetch}
#Fetch Sequence data in FASTA format for respective taxa. Retmax specified since web-history object is being used. 
actino_fetch <- entrez_fetch(db = "nuccore", web_history=actino_search$web_history, rettype = "fasta", retmax=4000)
show("take a break" )
firmi_fetch <- entrez_fetch(db = "nuccore", web_history=firmi_search$web_history, rettype = "fasta", retmax=4000)

#Use these lines to access max records for each data set
#actino_fetch <- entrez_fetch(db = "nuccore", web_history=actino_search$web_history, rettype = "fasta", retmax=actino_max)
#firmi_fetch <- entrez_fetch(db = "nuccore", web_history=firmi_search$web_history, rettype = "fasta", retmax=firmi_max)


#Write sequence data to directory. FASTA files subsequently viewed with text editor. The following lines have been commented to prevent overwriting.
write(actino_fetch, "actino_fetch.fasta", sep = "\n")
write(firmi_fetch, "firmi_fetch.fasta", sep = "\n")
```


####Put Sequence Data into Dataframe----
```{r Dataframe}
#Read in FASTA files as DNA StringSets and verify class
actino_stringSet <- readDNAStringSet("actino_fetch.fasta")
firmi_stringSet <- readDNAStringSet("firmi_fetch.fasta")

dffirmi <- data.frame(Title_16S = names(firmi_stringSet), Sequence_16S = paste(firmi_stringSet))

#Add a Phylum column to each dataframe
dfactinophylum<-dfactino %>% 
  add_column(Phylum="actinobacteria")
dffirmiphylum<-dffirmi %>% 
  add_column(Phylum="firmicutes")

##Combine the two dataframes into 1 dataframe
df_firmi_actino <-bind_rows(dffirmiphylum,dfactinophylum)
```


####Explore the Data----
```{r Explore}

```


####Calculate K-mers----

```{r K-mers}
#Convert the sequences to DNAStringSet (actually- created a new column just to be safe)
df_firmi_actino$Sequence_16S2<-DNAStringSet(df_firmi_actino$Sequence_16S)

#Calculate K-mers of length 4 and append to dataframe 
df_firmi_actino_k4 <- cbind(df_firmi_actino, as.data.frame(oligonucleotideFrequency(df_firmi_actino$Sequence_16S2, 4)))
```


####Random Forest for 4-mers----

```{r 4-mers}
###Create a validation data set

#Convert Sequence_16S2 from a DNAStringSet back to a character data so tidyverse functions can be used 
df_firmi_actino_k4$Sequence_16S2<-as.character(df_firmi_actino_k4$Sequence_16S2)

#Set seed so results are reproducible in the future
set.seed(217)

#Sample 1000 individuals from each phylum (~25% of individuals per phylum)
dfvalidation_k4 <-df_firmi_actino_k4 %>% 
  group_by(Phylum)%>% 
  sample_n(1000)

#Confirm that phyla are equally represented in the validation set
dfvalidation_k4 %>% 
  count(Phylum)

###Create a Training Dataset

#Create a training set composed of 2000 hits from each phylum
dfTraining_k4 <- df_firmi_actino_k4 %>%
  filter(!Title_16S %in% dfvalidation_k4$Title_16S) %>% 
  group_by(Phylum) %>%
  sample_n(2000)

#Confirm that Phyla are equally represented in the training set
dfTraining_k4 %>%

```

###Build an RF Classifier
```{r RF Classifier}


#Build a classifier to classify phylum by 4-mer frequency and assess the importance of predictors

phylum_classifier_k4 <- randomForest(x = dfTraining_k4[, 5:260], y = as.factor(dfTraining_k4$Phylum), ntree = 600, importance = TRUE)

  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black")) + labs(x="Number of trees", y = "Error rate") 

#Explanations for the most relevant model choices:
#n-tree set to be twice the size of the number of data points in the training set (4000) to enable so data points to make it into the model more than once; a higher ntree is not initially selected due to the greater computational power required, but it is understood that this can be revisited if model performance need to be improved.
#x=dfTraining[,5:260] because we're using the columns containing k-mer data as features to train our model
#y=as.factor because response vector is phylum (classifier)
#na.action omitted because there are no NAs in dataset
#xtest and ytest left to NULL, because we've already subsetted the data into training and test sets
#ntree=4000 because training set is 2000 observations and we want to ensure every input row gets predicted at least a few times
#mtry=sqrt(number of variables in x), the default for classification, was used. This is the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split;found to negligibly impact classification rates (Cutler et al. 2007)
#replace=TRUE, the default, to sample with replacement because the predictive categories are relatively balanced and therefore we're less concerned about bias resulting from sampling with replacement
#classwt=NUll, the default, because data is balanced (4000 for each taxa)
#cutoff=1/k, the default probability  cutoff
```


###Assess the Results of the RF Classifier
```{r Classifier Result}

##RF Validation Set Assessment #1: Confusion Matrix. Use random forest classifier to try and predict phylum for validation set


#Encode phylum (the target categorical feature) of validation data as factor with two levels. This is necessary because confusionMatrix() requires that 'data' and 'reference be factors with the same levels.
dfvalidation_k4$Phylum = factor(dfvalidation_k4$Phylum, levels = c("actinobacteria","firmicutes"))

#Create a prediction (of phylum, from test data) (using caret library)

#method=class because this is a classification tree; if it were a regression tree we would use ANOVA
#parms=list('gini') left to default. By default, rpart uses gini impurity to select splits when performing classification which gives equal penalization of mislabeled target classes. If we wanted to train the tree to penalize the mislabeling of some target classes more than others, we could change the loss component of the parms parameter to a matrix via parms=list('loss')
#weights left unspecified because we don't want to ascribe higher/lower weights to particular features
#subset left unspecified because we wish to use all of rows in the fit
#na.action left unspecified because we pre-screened for missing data
#Cost left unspecified because we don't wish to more heavily penalize false positives or false negatives. If we had prominent class imbalances we might revisit this.
